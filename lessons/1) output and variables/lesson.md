# Basics, Output, and Variables


## Introduction
So you want to become a programmer? Well you came to the right class because that is what I am gonna teach y'all.

When people think of programming, they think that it's super hard and that only [badass people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WH6cbwZ5m8?t=22) can code.
Well that is far from the truth. This video right [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HluANRwPyNo) will show what programming really is about.

But I hope that near the end of my class, you will be confident to try and program your own projects
and work on some passion projects of yours.

Lets jump into it.
## Language

So as I have mentioned before, I will be teaching this class in three languages
- C++
- Java
- Typescript

### C++
C++ is the hardest language to learn in my opinion, but it is one of the most popular languages
due to it's speed efficiency over other languages. I would only recommend this language to those who either want a challange, or those who want to become software engineers.

### Java
Java is around the medium range of diffuculty. But it's biggest advantage is that you can run it on any machine
without any issue. Most languages require you to retype some code for it to work on another operating system.
I would recommend this language for those who want to run their code on a private server and don't want to deal with the hassle of setting up stuff.

### Typescript
Typescript is the easiest language to learn in this class. It is essentially Javascript, but it has the ability to categorize your data so you won't run into many errors when running your code.
But the biggest advantage is that Javascript/Typescript is used in almost all web based applications. Meaning that if you ever want to become a web developer, you will be one step closer by taking this class.

### Don't be scared when picking a language
Picking a language is hard. But here is a little tip, once you understand one language, it's easier to understand most programming languages as you will soon see.
So if you don't like the language you picked and want to switch it up, then go for it. The most you will have to do is learn that languages rules which is some small differences.
## Basics
Most languages will have a function that runs whenever the code starts (Typescript does no have one).
In the case of Java and C++, it's called the main. All the code you type must be in the main function in order for it to run.
If you don't, then 99% of the time, your code will fail.

Eventually we go more indepth in functions but for now, just take my word for it.

### Common Errors
For beginners, there is usually a pattern of errors that they will occur.
So here is a little list of solutions that should help with most of those errors.

- **Capitalization** (make sure it is capitalized correctly)
- **Missing semicolon** (make sure to put a semicolon at the end of your code)
- **Outside the main** (make sure your code is inside the main)
- **Variable does not exist** (make sure you code the variable above the code using it)
- **Missing parenthesis** (make sure you have a () and not a ) )
- **Missing bracket** (you probably deleted a bracket, just put it back in)
- **Missing package** (you either delted the package your code used, or it wasn't added to your file)
## Variables
Variables are pieces of code that have the sole purpose of storing information for us. It can be anywhere from text, numbers, booleans, and much more.

Here are the different variables that you will use when coding.

### C++
- **int**: a whole number (2 for example)
- **float**: a number that can have decimals, it must have an **F** at the end (2.14f for example)
- **double**: the same as a float but it can hold bigger numbers and doesn't need an **F** (2.14 for example)
- **long**: can hold really big numbers, only use if you plan on needing to use big numbers (4206942069 for example)
- **char**: can hold a single letter ('f' for example)
- **string**: can hold a a bunch of letters ("Hello World" for example) (be sure to add #include <string> under #include <iostream>)
- **boolean**: can either be true or false (true for example)

### Java
- **int**: a whole number (2 for example)
- **float**: a number that can have decimals, it must have an **F** at the end (2.14f for example)
- **double**: the same as a float but it can hold bigger numbers and doesn't need an **F** (2.14 for example)
- **long**: can hold really big numbers, only use if you plan on needing to use big numbers (4206942069 for example)
- **char**: can hold a single letter ('f' for example)
- **string**: can hold a a bunch of letters ("Hello World" for example)
- **boolean**: can either be true or false (true for example)

### TypeScript

- **number**: can be whole or have decimals (2 or 2.14 for example)
- **string**: can be a single character or more ("f" or "Hello World" for example)
- **boolean**: can either be true or false (false for example)



## Output
When we are talking about output, we are talking about displaying information on the console.
This can be anything from text, numbers, booleans, and other stuff.
Here is how you can output information to the console

### C++
cout << "Hello World!" << endl;

cout << 2 << endl;

cout << "Hello, my name is " << name << endl;

- **cout**: starts the process of displaying info on the console
- **<<:** tells the computer to move to the next section of 
- **"Hello World!"**: this will display whatever you put in the parenthesis. It can be a string, a number, or a variable 
- **endl**: this will end the line the console is on and move to the next line

### Java
System.out.println("Hello World!");

System.out.println(2);

System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + name);

System.out.print("Hello");

- **System.out.println()** this will display whatever you put in the parenthesis. It can be a string, a number, or a variable 
- **System.out.print()** this will do the same as **System.out.println()**, but won't end the line it is on

### Typescript
console.log("Hello World!");

console.log(2);

console.log("Hello, my name is " + name);

- **console.log()** this will display whatever you put in the parenthesis. It can be a string, a number, or a variable
## Coding
Now that you know what variables are and how to output data to the console.
Let's go ahead and code your first program.

We will make a program that will say "Hello, my name is name and I have been playing pnw since year

## Conclusion
And now you have taken your first steps towards becoming a programmer. For next class,
we will be covering operators, if statements, and variables 2.

See y'all this monday!!!!
