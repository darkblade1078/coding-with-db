//Typescript doesn't need a main function to run like other languages, but you will need functions eventually

//can be whole or decimal
let number: number = 1;
let number2: number = 2.14;

//can be equal to true or false
let check: boolean = true;

//use for text or chars
let username: string = "Bobby J";
let char: string = "B";

//console.log() is your output, every time you want to output something, you use that
//every console.log() will be on it's own line
console.log("Hello, my name is " + username + "!!!!!");
console.log(number);
console.log(number2);
console.log(check);
console.log(char);
