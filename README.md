## FAQ

#### Is coding hard?

Not really, it will seem a bit hard at first, but once you learn the basics of whatever language you choose,
then it will become much easier to code your own projects.

#### What language should i use?

It really comes down to personal preference. 

- C++ is a harder to understand language but it's the fastest out of the three. 

- Java is easier to understand, and it you can run it on almost anything without having to change code. It's also what most colleges teach as a first language.

- Typescript is the easiest to learn in my opinion. It's essentially javascript with extra features. So if you can learn typescript, then you will be well on your way to making webservers.

#### Can I use the source code for my projects?

Yes, you can use any of the code in here, though I recommend you know how that code works
before using it.
